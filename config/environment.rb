# It's goals are:
# 1. To load all gems via bundler.
# 2. To establish a database connection or Sequel to use.
# 3. To load all the files of our application, models, concerns, controllers

# Load Bundler

# A little about ENV['SINATRA_ENV']
# ENV is a constant that is provided by ruby that stores Environmental
# variables in a hash. These variables cross the boundary of our application,
# to the system the application runs on. Thus, a command line argument
# or a BASH variable will be present in this object.

# Rack likes to store the mode our application should run within a variable
# called SINATRA_ENV with ENV. This allows our application to run in different
# modes with different settings and configurations.

# The two modes we are interested in are "development" and "test".

# Establish our Database connection.
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
  :adapter => "sqlite3",
  :database => "db/#{ENV['SINATRA_ENV']}.sqlite"
)

# require_all is a gem that you pass it a directory
# and it loads all .rb in there.
